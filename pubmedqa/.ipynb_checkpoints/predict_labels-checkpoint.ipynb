It was hypothesized that the operated limb would have weaker muscles, lower mechanical loading and that operated knee pain and muscle strength symmetry would predict loading symmetry between limbs during STS. One hundred and forty-two patients, 6 or 12 months post-unilateral TKA, underwent 3D motion analysis (VICON) of the STS task and isometric strength testing of the quadriceps and hip abductors. Knee pain was also quantified using a question from the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale. The operated limb had weaker quadriceps (P < 0.001), lower hip (P = 0.004) and knee extension moments (P < 0.001), and lower vertical ground reaction forces (P < 0.001). Operated knee pain and quadriceps strength symmetry were related to symmetry in knee extension moment (P < 0.04), and vertical ground reaction forces (P < 0.02) 6 months after surgery, while quadriceps strength symmetry was related to symmetry in vertical ground reaction forces (P = 0.03), 1 year after surgery.</s>\n",

To correlate serial MR-measurable changes in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with clinical response to treatment. We retrospectively reviewed clinical notes, conventional MR sequences and DWI in eight children with intracranial pus collections. Trace DWI signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared at three time points: at initial diagnosis (eight children, 13 collections), at follow-up during continued clinical infection (three children, sp collections), and at follow-up when clinical infection had resolved (seven children, 12 collections). At initial diagnosis all patients were septic and collections showed restricted diffusion (mean ADC 0.61+/-0.15 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). Patients with persistent clinical sepsis at follow-up DWI had collections with persistent low ADC values (0.66+/-0.21 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), significantly (P<0.001) below normal cortical gray matter values. Successful resolution of the infection was associated with a significant rise in ADC values (1.57+/-0.57 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P<0.01) compared both to patients with signs of continued sepsis and to normal gray matter values.</s>\n",

      "<s>Does arginase inhibition reduce endothelial dysfunction and blood pressure rising in spontaneously hypertensive rats?</s></s>A decrease in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability has been proposed to contribute to endothelial dysfunction and increased peripheral resistances during essential arterial hypertension. Given that arginine is a substrate for both arginase and NO synthase, arginase activity may be a critical factor in NO bioavailability. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of the arginase inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Vascular reactivity experiments were performed on thoracic aortic rings from 10-week-old SHR and their normotensive counterparts, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method. DFMO treatment (30 mg/kg daily in drinking water) was started in 5-week-old SHR and maintained for 5 weeks. Aortic arginase I and arginase II expression as well as arginase activity were evaluated by western blotting and the spectrophotometric method, respectively. DFMO (1.2 x 10 mol/l) enhanced the vascular response to acetylcholine both in SHR (+24%, P < 0.01) and WKY rats (+12%, P < 0.01), and reversed the effects of the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester. The vasorelaxant response to sodium nitroprusside on endothelium-denuded rings was not affected by DFMO, neither in SHR nor in WKY rats. In SHR, DFMO prevented the increase in blood pressure and improved the response of aortic rings to acetylcholine. Finally, as compared with WKY rats, SHR exhibited increased expression of vascular arginase I (+72%, P < 0.05) and arginase II (+91%, P < 0.05) as well as increased arginase activity (+26%, P < 0.05).</s>\n",
