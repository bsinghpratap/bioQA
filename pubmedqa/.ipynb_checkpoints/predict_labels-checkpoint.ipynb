      "<s>Does addition of clonidine in caudal anesthesia in children increase duration of post-operative analgesia?</s></s>Pain in infancy is a developmental process. Due to the underdeveloped pain pathways in the spinal cord, the threshold of stimulation and sensation of pain is low at birth and has potential impacts on increasing the central effects of pain. Primary trauma during infancy can cause long term changes in structure and function of pain pathways that continue until adulthood. Lack of pain management in children can result in morbidity and mortality. In this study we examined the duration of post-operative analgesia in children when clonidine is added to bupivacaine in caudal anesthesia. In this clinical trial, 40 children aged 1-8 years who were candidates for elective inguinal hernia repair were studied. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia were achieved using sodium thiopenthal, halothane and nitrous oxide. Children were randomly divided into 2 groups in a double-blind fashion, and were given caudal anesthesia with 0.125% bupivacaine (1ml/kg) alone or b bupivacaine plus 2 μg/kg clonidine. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded peri-operatively. Analgesia was evaluated using objective pain scale (OPS) and sedation was assessed using Ramsay sedation scale (RSS). Acetaminophen was administered rectally for cases with OPS score greater than five. Duration of analgesia was found to be significantly longer in the group given bupivacaine plus clonidine (mean 417.50 min vs. 162.00 min). Peri-operative hypotension or bradycardia, post-operative respiratory depression, nausea or vomiting were not recorded in any patient.</s>\n",

      "<s>Does increased gut permeability early after burns correlate with the extent of burn injury?</s></s>To determine if increased gut permeability within 48 hrs after burn injury correlates with the extent of injury, before sepsis and pulmonary disorders have complicated the clinical course. Nonrandomized, controlled study. Consecutive patients admitted with burn injuries on > 20% of body surface area. Intestinal absorption and renal excretion of polyethylene glycol 3350 was used as the macromolecule to determine gut permeability; polyethylene glycol 400 intestinal absorption was used as an internal control for abnormal motility and malabsorption. Polyethylene glycol 3350 (40 g) and polyethylene glycol 400 (5 g) were administered enterally. Gut permeability was significantly increased early after the injury. The patients excreted 0.56 +/- 0.34% (n = 11) of polyethylene glycol 3350, compared with the amount (0.12 +/- 0.04%) (p <.05) previously reported in normal volunteers. There was no significant difference in the excretion of polyethylene glycol 400 in the patients (27.0 +/- 4.6%, n = 11) vs. the normal volunteers previously reported (26.3 +/- 5.1%, n = 12), suggesting normal intestinal motility and absorption. The percentage of excretion of polyethylene glycol 3350 correlated with the percentage body surface burned; patients with smaller injuries excreted 0.32 +/- 0.17% (n = 6), which was greater than normal and less than those values from patients with larger injuries, 0.84 +/- 0.25% (n = 5) (p <.001 by Turkey test).</s>\n",

      "<s>Is adjuvant chemotherapy associated with decreased mortality after radical cystectomy for locally advanced bladder cancer?</s></s>We sought to evaluate the association of adjuvant chemotherapy with the risk of subsequent mortality among patients with locally advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder undergoing radical cystectomy (RC). We identified 675 patients who underwent RC for pT2-4 and/or N+ UC between 1980 and 2005. Adjuvant chemotherapy was defined as treatment within 90 days of RC. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared according to receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy with the log-rank test. Multivariate models were used to analyze the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease progression and survival. A total of 80 (12 %) patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Median age was 69 years [interquartile range (IQR) 63, 76]. Median follow-up was 11 years (IQR 8, 16). Patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to have pT3-4 tumors (71 vs. 61 %; p < 0.001) and pN+ (85 vs. 19 %; p < 0.001). The 5-year cancer-specific survival was 46 % in those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and 51 % in those that did not (p = 0.63). The 5-year overall survival was 39 % in those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and 38 % in those that did not (p = 0.24). When controlling for age, sex, stage, and performance status, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a 29 % decrease in the risk of bladder cancer death (HR 0.71, p = 0.06) and a 39 % decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.61, p = 0.002).</s>\n",
