      "QUESTION: Does fluoridation reduce the use of dental services among adults?\n",
      "CONTEXT: The authors determine whether prevention influences the use of health services. Fluoridation's effect on restorative dental demand among 972 Washington state employees and spouses, aged 20 to 34 years, in two fluoridated communities and a nonfluoridated community was examined. At baseline, adults were interviewed by telephone, and oral assessments were conducted to measure personal characteristics, lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, oral disease, and the quality of restorations. Adults were followed for 2 years to measure dental demand from dental claims. Each adult's baseline and claims data were linked with provider and practice variables collected from the dentist who provided treatment. Relative to adults with no lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, adults drinking fluoridated water for half or more of their lives had less disease at baseline and a lower but nonsignificant probability of receiving a restoration in the follow-up period. In the 2-year follow-up period, however, more than half of the restorations were performed to replace fillings of satisfactory or ideal quality at baseline. When only teeth with decay and unsatisfactory fillings at baseline were considered, adults with high fluoridation exposure had a lower probability of receiving a restoration than adults with no exposure. Market effects also were detected in demand equations; relative to adults in the nonfluoridated community, adults residing in the fluoridated community with a large dentist supply received a greater number of restorations, suggesting potential supplier-induced demand from less disease and fewer patients.\n",

      "QUESTION: Is the international normalised ratio (INR) reliable?\n",
      "CONTEXT: As part of an MRC funded study into primary care oral anticoagulation management, INR measurements obtained in general practice were validated against values on the same samples obtained in hospital laboratories. A prospective comparative trial was undertaken between three hospital laboratories and nine general practices. All patients attending general practice based anticoagulant clinics had parallel INR estimations performed in general practice and in a hospital laboratory. 405 tests were performed. Comparison between results obtained in the practices and those in the reference hospital laboratory (gold standard), which used the same method of testing for INR, showed a correlation coefficient of 0.96. Correlation coefficients comparing the results with the various standard laboratory techniques ranged from 0.86 to 0.92. It was estimated that up to 53% of tests would have resulted in clinically significant differences (change in warfarin dose) depending upon the site and method of testing. The practice derived results showed a positive bias ranging from 0.28 to 1.55, depending upon the site and method of testing.\n",

      "QUESTION: Is there a role for leukocyte and CRP measurements in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly?\n",
      "CONTEXT: The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is still difficult and the results are unsatisfactory in three particular patient groups: in children, in fertile-age women and in elderly patients. As our population ages, the challenge for expedient diagnosis and intervention in older age groups will become more and more significant. The present study aimed at clarifying the role of leukocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly. In particular, are there patients with acute appendicitis but unelevated leukocyte count and CRP? Eighty-three consecutive elderly patients underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis. The mean leukocyte count and CRP value were calculated in patients with an uninflamed appendix (group A) and in those with acute appendicitis (group B). The percentages of patients with: (1) both values unelevated; (2) only leukocyte count elevated; (3) only CRP value elevated; (4) both values elevated were calculated within the groups A and B. There was no statistically significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix (group A) and those with acute appendicitis (group B). When the patients were divided into the four subgroups, the most conspicuous finding was that group B (acute appendicitis, n = 73) contained no patients with both values unelevated.\n",

      "QUESTION: Residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: is fundectomy safe and effective as revision surgery?\n",
      "CONTEXT: Up to 30 % of patients who have undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy require revision surgery for inadequate weight loss, weight regain, and/or the development of severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) in cases of a residual fundus/neofundus development regarding GERD symptoms. The study group comprised 19 patients (17 female; mean BMI 35.4 kg/m(2)) divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 10) patients with severe GERD and evidence of residual fundus/neofundus, Hiatal hernia with good results in terms of weight loss. Group B (n = 9) patients with severe GERD, a residual fundus/neofundus, inadequate weight loss or weight regain. Fundectomy was indicated when a residual fundus/neofundus was associated with severe GERD symptoms. The presence of a residual fundus/neofundus was assessed by a barium swallow and/or multislice computed tomography. No mortality or intra-operative complications occurred. Five postoperative complications occurred: 2 cases of bleeding, 1 mid-gastric stenosis and 2 leaks (10.5 %). All patients experienced improvements in their GERD symptoms and stopped PPI treatment. Group B exhibited an additional %EWL of 53.4 % at 24 months.\n",

      "QUESTION: CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea: does it offer a better quality of life and sleep?\n",
      "CONTEXT: The recent literature shows an increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). On the other hand, there are no published studies related to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in this patient group. Our aim was to assess the effect of CPAP on sleep and overall life quality parameters in IPF patients with OSA and to recognize and overcome possible difficulties in CPAP initiation and acceptance by these patients. Twelve patients (ten males and two females, age 67.1 ± 7.2 years) with newly diagnosed IPF and moderate to severe OSA, confirmed by overnight attended polysomnography, were included. Therapy with CPAP was initiated after a formal in-lab CPAP titration study. The patients completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at CPAP initiation and after 1, 3, and 6 months of effective CPAP therapy. A statistically significant improvement was observed in the FOSQ at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation (baseline 12.9 ± 2.9 vs. 14.7 ± 2.6 vs. 15.8 ± 2.1 vs. 16.9 ± 1.9, respectively, p = 0.02). Improvement, although not statistically significant, was noted in ESS score (9.2 ± 5.6 vs. 7.6 ± 4.9 vs. 7.5 ± 5.3 vs. 7.7 ± 5.2, p = 0.84), PSQI (10.7 ± 4.4 vs. 10.1 ± 4.3 vs. 9.4 ± 4.7 vs. 8.6 ± 5.2, p = 0.66), FSS (39.5 ± 10.2 vs. 34.8 ± 8.5 vs. 33.6 ± 10.7 vs. 33.4 ± 10.9, p = 0.44), SF-36 (63.2 ± 13.9 vs. 68.9 ± 13.5 vs. 72.1 ± 12.9 vs. 74.4 ± 11.3, p = 0.27), and BDI (12.9 ± 5.5 vs. 10.7 ± 4.3 vs. 9.4 ± 4.8 vs. 9.6 ± 4.5, p = 0.40). Two patients had difficulty complying with CPAP for a variety of reasons (nocturnal cough, claustrophobia, insomnia) and stopped CPAP use after the first month, despite intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff. Heated humidification was added for all patients in order to improve the common complaint of disabling nocturnal cough.\n",

      "CONTEXT: The present study asked whether the processing of affective prosody is modulated by spatial attention. Pseudo-words with a neutral, happy, threatening, and fearful prosody were presented at two spatial positions. Participants attended to one position in order to detect infrequent targets. Emotional prosody was task irrelevant. The electro-encephalogram (EEG) was recorded to assess processing differences as a function of spatial attention and emotional valence. Event-related potentials (ERPs) differed as a function of emotional prosody both when attended and when unattended. While emotional prosody effects interacted with effects of spatial attention at early processing levels (<200 ms), these effects were additive at later processing stages (>200 ms).\n",

      "QUESTION: Cancer of the buccal mucosa: are margins and T-stage accurate predictors of local control?\n",
      "CONTEXT: Cancer of the buccal mucosa is an uncommon and aggressive neoplasm of the oral cavity. Less than 2% of patients treated for cancer of the oral cavity at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) from 1971 to 1997 had primary buccal cancers. Because the majority of these patients did not undergo any adjuvant treatment, this group provided us with the opportunity to assess the relationship between margin status and local recurrence for both small (T1-T2) and large (T3-T4) tumors treated with surgery alone. The RPCI tumor registry database reported 104 patients who were treated for buccal carcinoma. A retrospective chart review identified 27 patients who met our criteria for a buccal mucosal primary tumor (epicenter of the mass in the buccal mucosa). There were 13 men and 14 women, ranging in age from 34 to 94 years (mean, 75). Data were collected regarding patient demographics, presenting symptoms, stage, treatment received, and outcome. All patients underwent surgical resection of their primary lesion; 21 (75%) had T1 or T2 tumors. The rate of local recurrence was 56% for the group as a whole. Patients with close or positive margins had a 66% local failure rate as compared with 52% when surgical margins were negative (greater than or equal to 5 mm from the resection margin after tissue fixation; P = ns). Among those in whom negative margins were achieved, patients with T1-T2 disease had a 40% local failure rate with surgical resection alone.\n",

      "QUESTION: Patient comprehension of emergency department care and instructions: are patients aware of when they do not understand?\n",
      "CONTEXT: To be able to adhere to discharge instructions after a visit to the emergency department (ED), patients should understand both the care that they received and their discharge instructions. The objective of this study is to assess, at discharge, patients' comprehension of their ED care and instructions and their awareness of deficiencies in their comprehension. We conducted structured interviews of 140 adult English-speaking patients or their primary caregivers after ED discharge in 2 health systems. Participants rated their subjective understanding of 4 domains: (1) diagnosis and cause; (2) ED care; (3) post-ED care, and (4) return instructions. We assessed patient comprehension as the degree of agreement (concordance) between patients' recall of each of these domains and information obtained from chart review. Two authors scored each case independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance rating (no concordance, minimal concordance, partial concordance, near concordance, complete concordance). Seventy-eight percent of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension (less than complete concordance) in at least 1 domain; 51% of patients, in 2 or more domains. Greater than a third of these deficiencies (34%) involved patients' understanding of post-ED care, whereas only 15% were for diagnosis and cause. The majority of patients with comprehension deficits failed to perceive them. Patients perceived difficulty with comprehension only 20% of the time when they demonstrated deficient comprehension.\n",

      "QUESTION: Do episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli?\n",
      "CONTEXT: To assess pain-related attentional biases among individuals with episodic migraine. Prior studies have examined whether chronic pain patients selectively attend to pain-related stimuli in the environment, but these studies have produced largely mixed findings and focused primarily on patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Limited research has implicated attentional biases among chronic headache patients, but no studies have been conducted among episodic migraineurs, who comprise the overwhelming majority of the migraine population. This was a case-control, experimental study. Three hundred and eight participants (mean age = 19.2 years [standard deviation = 3.3]; 69.5% female; 36.4% minority), consisting of 84 episodic migraineurs, diagnosed in accordance with International Classification of Headache Disorders (2(nd) edition) criteria using a structured diagnostic interview, and 224 non-migraine controls completed a computerized dot probe task to assess attentional bias toward headache-related pictorial stimuli. The task consisted of 192 trials and utilized 2 emotional-neutral stimulus pairing conditions (headache-neutral and happy-neutral). No within-group differences for reaction time latencies to headache vs happy conditions were found among those with episodic migraine or among the non-migraine controls. Migraine status was unrelated to attentional bias indices for both headache (F [1,306] = 0.56, P = .45) and happy facial stimuli (F [1,306] = 0.37, P = .54), indicating a lack of between-group differences. Lack of within- and between-group differences was confirmed with repeated measures analysis of variance.\n",

We tested the hypothesis that equal mastery of surgical clerkship objectives can be obtained in a clerkship with and without general surgery. Students chose any two surgical rotations and were assessed by written examination, objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), ward evaluations, self-assessment objectives questionnaire, and satisfaction survey. Data for 54 students showed no differences in scores between groups on any parameter. No specific concerns related to the absence of general surgery were identified.\n",

      "CONTEXT: There is increasing concern amongst educators that the provision of recorded lectures may reduce student attendance of live lectures. We therefore sought to determine if the provision of prerecorded lecture video podcasts (VODcasts) to first-year Graduate Entry to Medicine (GEM) students, affected attendance at 21 Physiology lectures within three separate pre-clinical modules. Data on lecture attendance, utilization of VODcasts, and whether VODcasts should replace live lectures were drawn from three surveys conducted in academic years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 on all first-year GEM students in two first-year pre-clinical modules where prerecorded Physiology VODcasts were available for viewing or downloading prior to scheduled live lectures. A total of 191/214 (89%) students responded to the three surveys, with 84.3% of students attending all 21 lectures in the study. Only 4% of students missed more than one lecture in each of the three lecture series, with 79% indicating that VODcasts should not replace lectures.\n",

      "QUESTION: Vaccine protection in the elderly: are Austrian seniors adequately protected by vaccinations?\n",
      "CONTEXT: The aim of the study was to evaluate, if elderly persons are sufficiently protected against infectious diseases by vaccination. 300 elderly (>60 years) and 300 young (<35 years) persons from five Austrian cities were recruited according to the criteria of a field study. Antibody concentrations against tetanus, diphtheria, tickborne encephalitis and influenza were assessed by ELISA or by haemagglutination inhibition test. Disease and vaccination histories were recorded. The results of the study demonstrate that protection against infectious diseases was frequently insufficient in the elderly. This was partly due to the fact that old persons were not vaccinated according to recommended strategies. However, low antibody concentration and a short duration of protective humoral immunity were also observed in many elderly persons in spite of regular vaccination. This was not only the case in frail, but also in healthy elderlies.\n",

      "CONTEXT: The optimal age at which to perform orchiopexy for cryptorchidism has long been debated. The aim of this study was to determine if age at orchiopexy affected testicular atrophy. A retrospective review of patients undergoing orchiopexy from 2000 to 2010 was conducted. An individual testis, rather than patient, was used as the dependent variable. A total of 349 testicles from 1126 charts (ICD-9=752.51) were identified. Primary study outcome was testicular survival without atrophy. Mean follow up for the study was 25 months. There was postoperative atrophy in 27 testes (7.7%). Intraabdominal testicle was independently associated with increased postsurgical atrophy (p<0.0001). The odds of postsurgical atrophy were 15.66 times higher for an abdominal vs. inguinal location (95% CI: 5.5-44.6). Testicular atrophy was highest for orchiopexy at ages 13-24 months (n=16 of 133, 12%) vs. those less than 13 months (n=3 of 64, 5%), and those greater than 24 months (n=8 of 152, 5%) (p=0.0024). After adjusting for location, age was not statistically significant with postsurgical atrophy (p=0.055).\n",

Five hundred women aged 52.57 +/- 8.08 years, without a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or complicated pregnancy were involved in the study. They were divided into three groups. Group 1: women with no or one parity (n = 76); group 2: women with two or three parities (n = 333); group 3: women with four or more parities (n = 91). Laboratory parameters and demographical data were compared between the three groups. Mean age, serum urea and serum creatinine were similar between three groups. Patients in group 3 had significantly higher GFR values compared to groups 1 and 2 (109.44 +/- 30.99, 110.76 +/- 30.22 and 121.92 +/- 34.73 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively; P = 0.008 for group 1 vs group 3; P = 0.002 for group 2 vs group 3).\n",

      "CONTEXT: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the pharmacokinetics of s.c. anti-TNF agents on the grade of US-detected synovitis in RA patients. Fifty RA patients were prospectively recruited from the Biologic Therapy Unit of our hospital. Inclusion criteria were being in treatment with s.c. anti-TNF agents and having had neither changes in therapy nor local corticosteroid injections in the previous 3 months. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory [28-joint DAS (DAS28) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)]and US assessment at two time points, i.e. at peak plasma drug concentration and at trough plasma drug concentration. US assessments were performed blindly to the anti-TNF agent, the administration time and the clinical and laboratory data. Twenty-eight joints were investigated for the presence and grade (0-3) of B-mode synovitis and synovial power Doppler signal. Global indices for B-mode synovitis (BSI) and Doppler synovitis (DSI) were calculated for 12 joints and for wrist-hand-ankle-foot joints. B-mode US remission was defined as a BSI<1 and Doppler US remission as a DSI<1. There were no significant differences between the clinical, laboratory and B-mode and Doppler US parameters at peak time and trough time (P = 0.132-0.986). There were no significant differences between the proportion of patients with active disease and those in remission according to DAS28, SDAI, B-mode US and Doppler US at peak time and trough time assessments (P = 0.070-1).\n",

      "CONTEXT: The CLASS Act, which was part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, established a voluntary personal assistance services (PAS) insurance program. However, concerns about enrollment and adverse selection led to repeal of the CLASS Act in 2013. To estimate the number of middle-aged adults interested in purchasing PAS insurance, the sociodemographic, socioeconomic and disability attributes of this population, and the maximum monthly premium they would be willing to pay for such coverage. A total of 13,384 adults aged 40-65 answered questions about their interest in PAS insurance in the 2011 Sample Adult National Health Interview Survey. We applied survey weights for the U.S. population and conducted logistic regression analyses to identify personal factors associated with interest in paying for the CLASS program. An estimated 25.8 million adults aged 40-65 (26.7%) said they would be interested in paying for a public insurance program to cover PAS benefits. However, interest in PAS insurance varied by age, race, ethnicity, region, income, disability status, and family experience with ADL assistance. Only 1.6 million adults aged 40-65 (1.8%) said they would be willing to pay $100 per month or more for coverage.\n",

Data extracted included falls risk identification during rehabilitation and in discharge documentation; falls risk factors assessed; and fall prevention strategies implemented. Discharge documentation correctly identified falls risk for just nine of the 50 people. Patients at high falls risk had a median of 8.0 (interquartile range 6-10) of 17 risk factors. There was limited evidence of assessment for osteoporosis (n = 8), footwear (n = 4) and visual assessment in the previous 2 years (n = 1). Patients received a median of 6.5 (interquartile range 5-9) out of 16 possible strategies. Common strategies were mobility (n = 48), strength (n = 44) and Personal Activity of Daily Living training (n = 43). For 12 risk factors, if the factor was present, there was evidence of a strategy in more than 80% of records.\n",

      "CONTEXT: We evaluated the differences between percutaneous ethanol injection with and without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid for treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules. We examined 60 patients with benign cystic thyroid nodules confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and divided them into 2 groups according to nonaspiration (group A, n = 30) or aspiration (group B, n = 30) of ethanol-mixed fluid after intracystic ethanol injection. We evaluated in both groups the complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule on follow-up ultrasonography (first follow-up ultrasonography; mean, 4.6 months in group A; mean, 4.4 months in group B) (chi-square test), side effects or complications during and after the procedure (chi-square test), and the total procedure time (Student t test). Most patients showed complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule (group A, n = 29; group B, n = 28), and they revealed no recurrence on follow-up ultrasonography. There was no statistical difference in the success rates between group A and group B (P>.05). Pain, the most common side effect, and other mild side effects or complications occurred in small numbers of patients in each group, but there was no significant difference in side effects or complications between the 2 groups (P>.05), except for intracystic hemorrhage (P<.05) and the complaint of all group B patients due to a double puncture (P<.001). The total procedure time was nearly double in group B than in group A because of the additional procedures, such as complete evacuation of the ethanol-mixed fluid and the 10-minute compression.\n",

We did this retrospective analysis to see if similar differences exist in the Indian population. Case records of 210 Indian patients diagnosed with AS according to modified New York criteria were reviewed. Data were collected regarding age of onset, clinical features, drug treatment, and outcome at last follow-up. Patients with onset before 17 years of age were classified as having juvenile AS (JAS) and the rest with adult AS (AAS). There were 150 patients with AAS and 60 with JAS.

      "CONTEXT: The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend. To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time. Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000. : Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual. At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).\n",

      "QUESTION: Delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations: are current guidelines sufficient?\n",
      "CONTEXT: Infants referred to our institution with a final diagnosis of ARM were retrospectively reviewed between 2001 and 2009. The first cohort consisted of patients that were referred between November 2001 and November 2006 with the diagnosis of an ARM that had been delayed for more than 48 h. The second cohort was those referred between December 2006 and May 2009 with whom the diagnosis of ARM had not been made within 24 h of birth. Nineteen infants were referred with delayed diagnosis of an ARM over the 7.5 years of the study. Of 44 patients referred to our institution between December 2006 and May 2009, diagnosis of an ARM was delayed more than 24 h in 14 (32%). There was no difference in gender, birth weight, prematurity, type of malformation or presence of associated anomalies between those with timely and delayed diagnosis of their ARM. A significantly greater proportion of those with a delayed diagnosis presented with obstructive symptoms (86% vs. 27%, P<0.001), including abdominal distension (57%) and delayed passage of meconium or stool (29%). Despite undergoing neonatal examination, the diagnosis of ARM was missed in 12 patients overall.\n",

      "QUESTION: Chemoradiation instead of surgery to treat mid and low rectal tumors: is it safe?\n",
      "CONTEXT: The main treatment for rectal carcinoma is surgery. Preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) is advocated to reduce local recurrence and improve resection of mid and low tethered rectal tumors. Fifty-two patients with mid or low rectal tumors underwent CRT (external beam radiation plus 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid). Patients who had low rectal tumors with complete response (CR) were not submitted to surgical treatment. All other patients were submitted to surgery, independently of the response. Mean follow-up was 32.1 months. Five-year overall survival was 60.5%. Clinical evaluation after CRT showed CR in 10 cases (19.2%), all low tumors; incomplete response (>50%) in 21 (40.4%); and no response (<50%) in 19 (36.6%). Among the 10 cases with CR, 8 presented with local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months. Two patients were not submitted to surgery and are still alive without cancer after 37 and 58 months. Thirty-nine patients had radical surgery. Seven had local recurrences after CRT plus surgery (17.9%). Overall survival was negatively affected by lymph node metastases (P =.017) and perineural invasion (P =.026).\n",

      "QUESTION: Does binge drinking during early pregnancy increase the risk of psychomotor deficits?\n",
      "CONTEXT: The potential effects of binge drinking during pregnancy on child motor function have only been assessed in a few, small studies. We aimed to examine the effects of binge alcohol consumption during early pregnancy, including number of binge episodes and timing of binge drinking, on child motor function at age 5. We performed a prospective follow-up study of 678 women and their children sampled from the Danish National Birth Cohort based on maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. At 5 years of age, the children were tested with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. Parental education, maternal IQ, prenatal maternal smoking, the child's age at testing, sex of child, and tester were considered core confounders, while the full model also controlled for prenatal maternal average alcohol intake, maternal age and prepregnancy body mass index, parity, home environment, postnatal parental smoking, health status, participation in organized sport, and indicators for hearing and vision impairment. There were no systematic or significant differences in motor function between children of mothers reporting isolated episodes of binge drinking and children of mothers with no binge episodes. No association was observed with respect to the number of binge episodes (maximum of 12) and timing of binge drinking.\n"
